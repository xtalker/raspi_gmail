"Create a repro page" has most of this:

Add file to list to be commited
git add FILENAME

To Check in staged files:
git commit -m 'comment about this commit'
git push origin master (try "push -force" option if this doesnt work)
  'origin" set with:
  git remote add origin https://github.com/xtalker/raspi_gmail.git
